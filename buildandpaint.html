        <!-- step 1 removing the model from the spr -->
        <img class=" imagesmall" src="image01.jpg" alt="The model on the sprue">
        <p>  This is the sprue. Firstly, carefully remove the model pieces from the sprue using plastic cutters or a craft knife.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <!-- step 2 clean the pieces -->
        <img class=" imagesmall" src="image02.jpg" alt="Clean pieces of the model">
        <p>Use a sanding pad or mould line remover to clean the model pieces where you removed them from the sprue and remove any mould lines from the model.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <!-- step 3 test fit the model pieces -->
        <img class=" imagesmall" src="image03.jpg" alt="Test fit the model pieces">
            <p>Before gluing the model together, assemble the model and test fit the pieces, you might need to make some adjustments to the pieces for a good fit.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <!-- step 4 basecoat and prime the model -->
        <img class="imagesmall" src="image04.jpg" alt="Prime the model in a black basecoat">
        <p>When the model is assembled, basecoat the model with a primer. This model is primed in abaddon black, but white, grey and other colours can also be used.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <!-- step 5 paint the primary colour -->
        <img class="imagesmall" src="image05.jpg" alt="Paint the primary colour">
        <p>Paint your primary colours one your model, donâ€™t worry about mistakes as these can be corrected afterwards.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <!-- step 6 painting lighter colours -->
        <img class=" imagesmall" src="image06.jpg" alt="Adding highlights">
        <p>Painting lighter colours over a dark basecoat will need several thin coats of paint. Allow time for each layer to dry before painting on the details.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <!-- step 7 basing for the model -->
        <img class=" imagesmall" src="image07.jpg" alt="Basing for the model">
        <p>Paint the awkward to reach details first as you may get paint on the surrounding areas which you can cover up later.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <!-- step 8 basing for the model -->
        <img class=" imagesmall" src="image08.jpg" alt="Basing for the model">
        <p>Take your time painting the details on the model, some details might need touching up after the paint has dried as some paints look a different colour when dry.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <!-- step 9 basing for the model -->
        <img class=" imagesmall" src="image09.jpg" alt="Basing for the model">
        <p>When you have finished with the details, you are done, you have a finished miniature</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <!-- End note -->
        <p>There are other painting methods which can be applied to this miniature such as "glazing" and "Edge highlighting" but for the time being this miniature is finished and ready for battle.</p>
