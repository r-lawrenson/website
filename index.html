    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Miniature painting is a fantastic hobby, it's relaxing and fun to do. Learning to paint miniatures will not only improve your painting skills, but it will also open your creative mind. You can be creative and paint your miniatures how you want and in whatever colour you want, the choice is yours! Creativity doesnâ€™t stop with painting, some miniatures are also a tabletop game, so you can enjoy creating your characters, use them in a game and begin creating your own stories.
